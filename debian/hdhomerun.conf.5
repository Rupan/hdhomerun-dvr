.SH "NAME"
.LP
\fBhdhomerun.conf\fR \- Configuration file for \fBhdhomerun_record(8)\fR.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
The SiliconDust HDHomeRun DVR (hdhomerun_record) defaults to using a configuration
file located at \fB/etc/hdhomerun.conf\fR.  The configuration file location
can be specifed at \fBhdhomerun_record(8)\fR startup time with the --conf
parameter.
.LP
The basic file format of the hdhomerun.conf is a newline-separated list
of environment-like shell-compatible variable assignments.
It is possible to source the configuration from shell scripts, however,
beyond mere variable assignments no shell features are supported,
allowing applications to read the file without implementing a shell
compatible execution engine.
.SH "OPTIONS"
The \fBhdhomerun.conf\fR configuration file supports the following specifications:
.LP
RecordPath=/Recording/Path[;/Alt1/Path[;/Alt2/Path]...] - \fBREQUIRED\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the full path for the directory where the recordings and log files
will be written.  The RecordPath is required.  The directory must be writeable
by the user running the recording engine (typically hdhomerun).  Optionally,
additional alternative paths may be specified where recordings will
be searched for.
.RE
.LP
Port=<port> - \fBOptional\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the port number that the recording engine will use to accept
client connections.  This is primarily needed for firewall
rules.
.RE
.LP
StorageID=<uuid> - \fBOptional\fR but \fBRecommended\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the StorageID that is provided to the my.hdhomerun.com
browser discovery/access service.  Without a StorageID being
specified the recorder will not show on the my.hdhomerun.com
service.  The value should be unique and generated with a tool
such as uuidgen.  While optional, this value is usually
recommended to be set for ease of use.
